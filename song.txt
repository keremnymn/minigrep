I'm going home to see my baby
Big sweet baby of mine
Been so long without my baby
Sometimes I feel
I'm plum goin' outta my mind
I'm leaving this town early next mornin
Big sweet baby of mine
It won't be long before we're together now
Baby and me, happy until the end of time

I just can't go on without him
I miss him more and more each day
And all I do is dream about my baby
And his lovin' ways
I need someone to live me
To take me by the hand
To lead me outta my misery
And tell me his still my man
That's why ...
I'm going home to see my baby
Big sweet baby of mine
Been so long without my baby
Sometimes I feel
I'm plum goin' outta my mind

Don't want to be no travller
Roaming all around this world
I just want to be nearby my baby
Cos I'm such a lonely girl

If I had a million dollars
I wouldn't be worth a dime
I couldn't spend that million dollars
With my Valentine

That's why ...
I'm going home to see my baby
Big sweet baby of mine
Been so long without my baby
Cos sometimes I feel
I'm plum goin' outta my mind

Sometimes I feel
I'm plum goin' outta my mind
